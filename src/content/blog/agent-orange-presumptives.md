## The Presumptive Connection

For decades, veterans have fought to prove their health conditions were caused by exposure to the toxic herbicide Agent Orange. To streamline this process, the VA has established a list of "presumptive conditions."

If you have one of these conditions and can prove you served in a qualifying location and time period, the VA will automatically assume (or "presume") that your condition was caused by your military service. You do not need to provide a medical nexus linking the illness to Agent Orange exposure.

### Key Presumptive Conditions Include:

- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
- Ischemic Heart Disease
- Parkinson's Disease
- Prostate Cancer
- Respiratory Cancers (lung, bronchus, larynx, or trachea)
- Hodgkin's Disease
- Multiple Myeloma
- And several others...

### Who is eligible?

Eligibility generally includes veterans who served:

- In the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975.
- On or near the Korean DMZ between September 1, 1967, and August 31, 1971.
- On U.S. Navy or Coast Guard ships that operated in Vietnam.
- In Thailand at any U.S. or Royal Thai base between 1962 and 1976.

The list of conditions and locations can change, so it's vital to check the VA's official website. If you have one of these illnesses, you have a clear path to the benefits you've earned.
