## What is TDIU?

Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU) is a part of the VA's disability compensation program that allows veterans to be paid at the 100% disability rate, even if their schedular rating is less than 100%.

The core idea is that the VA recognizes that certain disabilities, or a combination of them, can prevent a veteran from maintaining what the VA calls "substantially gainful employment," even if they don't meet the criteria for a 100% rating on paper.

### How to Qualify for TDIU:

There are two primary paths to be considered for TDIU:

**1. Schedular TDIU:** This is the most common path. You must meet two criteria:

- You have **one** service-connected disability rated at **60% or more**.
- **OR**, you have two or more service-connected disabilities with a combined rating of **70% or more**, with at least one of those disabilities rated at 40% or more.

**2. Extraschedular TDIU:** If you don't meet the percentage requirements above but your service-connected disabilities still prevent you from working, you can still apply. These cases are more complex and are decided on an individual basis.

For both paths, you must prove that your service-connected conditions alone (not age or non-service connected issues) are the reason you cannot work. This often requires medical evidence, vocational expert opinions, and statements from former employers.
