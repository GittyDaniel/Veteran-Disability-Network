## More Than Just a "Friend's Note"

When it comes to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) claims, your personal statement about a traumatic event (the "stressor") is vital. But what if there were no official records of the event? What about the changes in your personality and behavior that you might not even see yourself?

This is where "buddy letters"—or more formally, Lay Statements in Support of a Claim—become some of the most powerful evidence you can submit. These are firsthand accounts from people who know you, and they can paint a picture for the VA that medical records alone cannot.

### Who Should Write a Buddy Letter?

- **Fellow Service Members:** Someone from your unit who witnessed the stressful event or saw you immediately after.
- **Spouse or Partner:** They see the day-to-day impact of your PTSD, like nightmares, irritability, or social withdrawal.
- **Parents or Siblings:** They can describe your personality _before_ service and contrast it with how you are now.
- **Close Friends:** They can attest to changes in your social habits or mood.

### What Makes a Buddy Letter Effective?

A good buddy letter is specific and factual. It should avoid making medical diagnoses (e.g., "He has PTSD"). Instead, it should focus on observable facts.

**Good Example:** "Before his deployment, John was outgoing and loved being around people. Since he came home, he avoids crowds and gets angry over small things. I've seen him wake up shouting from nightmares at least twice a month."

**Bad Example:** "John has severe PTSD from his time in Iraq and deserves 100%."

Provide your "buddies" with the right VA form (VA Form 21-10210) and guide them on what to write. These letters can be the key to winning your claim.
