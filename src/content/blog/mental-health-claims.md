## The Invisible Wounds

Unlike a physical injury, mental health conditions like PTSD, anxiety, and depression are invisible wounds. This can make them more challenging to prove to the VA, but it is far from impossible. A successful mental health claim requires three key elements.

### 1. Current Diagnosis

You must have a current diagnosis of a mental health condition from a qualified medical professional, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist. The diagnosis should be based on the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).

### 2. In-Service Stressor or Event

You must be able to point to a specific event, series of events, or circumstances during your service that caused or aggravated your mental health condition.

- **For PTSD:** This is your "stressor." It could be combat exposure, a personal assault, or witnessing a traumatic event. For combat veterans, the VA may concede the stressor occurred without specific proof.
- **For Anxiety/Depression:** This could be the cumulative stress of a high-pressure job, a specific difficult period during your service, or the result of another service-connected injury.

### 3. Medical Nexus

Finally, you need a medical opinion linking your current diagnosis to the in-service stressor. A "nexus letter" from your therapist or psychiatrist stating that it is "at least as likely as not" that your military service caused your condition is the gold standard for this element.

Proving these three things with medical records, personal statements, and buddy letters will give you the strongest possible chance of winning your claim.
