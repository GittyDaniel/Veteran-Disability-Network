## The Most Common Claim for a Reason

If you're a veteran, the constant ringing, buzzing, or hissing sound of tinnitus is probably no stranger to you. It's the single most prevalent service-connected disability for a reason: military service is loud. From engine rooms and flight lines to rifle ranges and combat zones, your hearing was constantly at risk.

The good news is that the VA recognizes this. However, just because it's common, doesn't mean it's an automatic approval. You still need to build a strong case.

### Key Steps for Your Tinnitus Claim:

1.  **Get a Diagnosis:** Your first step is to get a current medical diagnosis of tinnitus. If you don't have one, talk to your primary care doctor or an audiologist. There's no test to "prove" you have tinnitus—it's based on your reported symptoms—but a diagnosis is required.

2.  **Identify Your In-Service Noise Exposure:** You need to explain to the VA _how_ your hearing was damaged. This is where a strong personal statement comes in. Detail your Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), the equipment you worked with, your combat experience, and any specific events that involved high-intensity noise.

3.  **The Nexus Letter (If Needed):** A "nexus" is the link between your current disability and your time in service. For tinnitus, this is often straightforward. However, if your claim is complex, a nexus letter from a medical professional stating that your tinnitus is "at least as likely as not" caused by your military service can be incredibly powerful.

Don't underestimate the impact of tinnitus. It can disrupt sleep, affect concentration, and lead to anxiety and depression. Fight for the compensation you deserve.
