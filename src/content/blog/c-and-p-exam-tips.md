## Your Most Important Appointment

The Compensation and Pension (C&P) exam is the VA's method for evaluating the extent of your disability. The examiner's report has a massive impact on your claim's outcome and potential rating. Do not treat it like a routine doctor's visit.

Here are five tips to ensure you are prepared:

1.  **Review Your Records:** Before the exam, re-read your entire VA claims file, especially your personal statements and medical evidence. Be consistent with what you have already submitted.
2.  **Be Brutally Honest:** This is not the time to be a tough guy. Do not say "I'm fine" or "it's okay." Describe your worst days. Explain how your disability affects your ability to work, your social life, and your daily activities.
3.  **Provide Specific Examples:** Don't just say "my back hurts." Say, "My back hurts so much that I can't stand for more than 10 minutes, which means I can't do the dishes or stand in line at the grocery store."
4.  **Don't Exaggerate, But Don't Downplay:** Lying or exaggerating can destroy your credibility. However, minimizing your symptoms is just as damaging. Stick to the facts of your daily struggles.
5.  **Bring Notes:** It's easy to forget important details when you're nervous. Bring a list of your symptoms, how they affect you, and any questions you have for the examiner.

Walking into that exam prepared is half the battle. Your future benefits depend on it.
