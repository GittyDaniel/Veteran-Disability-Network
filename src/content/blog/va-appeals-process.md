## A Denial Isn't a Final "No"

Receiving a denial letter from the VA can be crushing. After months of waiting, it feels like a dead end. But it's crucial to understand that a denial is often just one step in the process. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), you have clear pathways to challenge the VA's decision.

You generally have one year from the date on your decision letter to choose one of these three lanes.

### Lane 1: Supplemental Claim (0995)

**When to use it:** This is your lane if you have **new and relevant evidence** to add to your case.

Maybe the VA said there was no diagnosis? You go get one and submit it. Maybe they said there was no link to your service? You get a powerful nexus letter from a doctor. This is the most common appeal type and essentially asks the VA to re-review your case with the new information.

### Lane 2: Higher-Level Review (0996)

**When to use it:** You believe the VA made a legal or factual error with the evidence they _already had_.

You cannot submit new evidence in this lane. You are asking for a more experienced reviewer to take a fresh look at your file and overturn the previous decision based on a mistake. You can also request an informal conference to speak with the reviewer over the phone and point out the error.

### Lane 3: Board Appeal (10182)

**When to use it:** You've been denied in the other lanes or you want your case to go directly to a Veterans Law Judge at the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

This is the most formal and time-consuming option. You can choose to submit more evidence, request a hearing with a judge, or simply have the Board review the existing evidence.

Choosing the right lane is critical to your success. Analyze your denial letter carefully to understand why the VA said no, and that will tell you which path to take.
