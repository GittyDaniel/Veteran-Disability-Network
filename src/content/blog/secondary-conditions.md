## Connecting the Dots for a Higher Rating

Many veterans focus only on the injuries or illnesses that began during their service. But what about the health problems that develop _because_ of those service-connected issues? These are called **secondary conditions**, and they are a critical component of maximizing your VA disability benefits.

The concept is simple: if a service-connected disability (A) causes or aggravates another disability (B), then disability B can also be service-connected.

### Common Examples of Secondary Claims:

- **Radiculopathy secondary to a back condition:** Your service-connected back injury causes pinched nerves, leading to pain, numbness, or tingling in your legs (sciatica).
- **Depression secondary to tinnitus:** The constant ringing in your ears from your service-connected tinnitus causes chronic sleep deprivation, anxiety, and leads to a diagnosis of clinical depression.
- **Erectile Dysfunction secondary to PTSD:** The medication you take for your service-connected PTSD has side effects that cause erectile dysfunction.
- **Heart Disease secondary to Diabetes:** Your service-connected Type 2 Diabetes (presumed from Agent Orange exposure) leads to the development of heart disease.

### How to Prove a Secondary Claim

The key to a successful secondary claim is the **medical nexus**. You must provide a medical opinion from a qualified professional that links your secondary condition to your primary service-connected disability.

A strong nexus letter will state that your secondary condition is "at least as likely as not" caused or aggravated by your primary condition. Without this medical link, the VA will almost certainly deny the claim.

Review your health records. Talk to your doctors. If you have health problems that started after your primary disability, you may have a strong case for a secondary claim.
